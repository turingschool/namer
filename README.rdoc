== Namer - Shared Turing CNAMEs

This application uses the DNSimple API to allow users to register custom CNAMES under the turingapps.io domain.

The intent is to give Turing students a convenient place to aggregate links to portfolio applications without
having to go through the hassle of registering and configuring their own domains.

Authentication is done via Github Oauth; to run the application you'll need these environment keys
provisioned: `NAMER_GITHUB_ID` and `NAMER_GITHUB_SECRET`
